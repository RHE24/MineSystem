<p>To be able to use MineSystem to its full potential, you need only a couple of things:</p>

<h3>
<a name="1-a-minecraft-server" class="anchor" href="#1-a-minecraft-server"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. A Minecraft Server</h3>

<p>This server needs to be accessible from any computer with a connection to the internet. In other words, no VPN or LogMeIn Hamachi servers!</p>

<h3>
<a name="2-a-web-server" class="anchor" href="#2-a-web-server"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. A Web Server</h3>

<p>This web server needs to be running the latest version of PHP and MySQL. For an easy to use web server for Windows, check out <a href="http://www.easyphp.org/">EasyPHP</a>.</p>
