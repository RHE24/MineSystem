{"name":"MineSystem","tagline":"Open Source CMS for Minecraft Servers","body":"# MineSystem: An Open Source CMS for Minecraft Server Websites\r\n\r\nMineSystem is an open source content management system, designed specifically for Minecraft server owners and administrators. MineSystem is written primarily in PHP, using HTML and CSS to cater for all your website needs. We understand that every good server needs a website - with unlimited flexibility, MineSystem will create that attractive looking website overnight, no programming knowledge required!\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nMineSystem is designed to be flexible and able to cater for your needs, however great. In addition to the main features listed below, you can find more on our wiki, on GitHub. As an open source project, we encourage you to make your own and share them with the rest of the community.\r\n\r\n* Dynamic Front Page\r\nThe front page of your website is what visitors will see first - it creates the first impression. It not only needs to look attractive, but also be functional in an easy to use way. The front page can have custom text and HTML, and widgets (more below) can be used to create a super dynamic front page.\r\n* Customizable Widgets\r\nMineSystem would not exist without widgets. Widgets are what create the functionality behind a MineSystem site. MineSystem comes with default widgets, such as login forms, notices and polls, but to really make your server website unique, you can find extra plugins (approved, of course) from the community on our wiki.\r\n* Fast and Reliable Users System\r\nTo communicate effectively and privately with your server users, MineSystem has a built in users system. MineSystem provides the functionality of automatic whitelisting from registration and/or console management from the website. Administrators can create user only pages and features, and registered users can post in the forums among other things.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nA more in-depth and detailed guide can be found on our wiki on GitHub. To be able to use MineSystem to its full potential, you need only a couple of things:\r\n### 1. A Minecraft Server\r\nThis server needs to be accessible from any computer with a connection to the internet. In other words, no VPN or LogMeIn Hamachi servers!\r\n### 2. A Web Server\r\nThis web server needs to be running the latest version of PHP and MySQL. For an easy to use web server for Windows, check out [EasyPHP](http://www.easyphp.org/).\r\n\r\n## Who Are We?\r\nMineSystem is a project from TheMushroomPeople (@themushroompeople).
